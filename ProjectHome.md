Here are the most commonly used algorithms and auxiliary utilities for fuzzy (similarity) string search in large dictionaries written in Java.

  * Levenshtein Distance (with cutoff and prefix version)
  * Damerau-Levenshtein Distance (with cutoff and prefix version)
  * Extension (Spell-checker) Method
  * N-Gram Method (with some modifications)
  * Signature Hash Method
  * Bitap (Shift-Or with Wu-Manber modifications)
  * Burkhard-Keller (BK) Trees
  * Skip algorithm

All implementations are aimed to provide simplicity and clarity of algorithm's work.
